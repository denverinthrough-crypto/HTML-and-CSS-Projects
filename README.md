MOVIE THEATER SITE
-  This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Boostrap 4. It contains many Boostrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.

MY PORTFOLIO
-  I’m currently building my personal portfolio website, where I’ll be showcasing all my ongoing projects, including:

🎨 Web design concepts and themed sites (like the Dr Disrespect Theme website).

⚙️ Frontend experiments and layouts

🚧 Upcoming creative projects and fan builds


Dr Disrespect Site
- Welcome to my Dr Disrespect Tribute Website — a fan-made project dedicated to the Two-Time, Back-to-Back Blockbuster Video Game Champion himself: Dr Disrespect.

This website celebrates the Doc’s larger-than-life personality, iconic style, and high-octane energy. Inspired by his trademark red and black color scheme, 80s synthwave vibes, and Champion’s Club attitude, the design reflects the world of violence, speed, and momentum.
